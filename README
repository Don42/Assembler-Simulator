= Assembler Simulator =
This program simulates a Von-Neumann-Computer. It has its own assembler language and runs on Java. Since it shows access to different registers it could be used to demonstrate the inner workings of the Von-Neumann-Architecture.
I created this with a group during a project at the DHBW in Mannheim. It has not been maintained since then.
